I couldn't submit it to an online judge, so beware: they may be buggy, or I may be wrong algogether.

Quick way of running one of the problems on the sample input:

`pypy3 A/andxor.py < A/1.in` (or `python` if you want to use the standard Python interpreter)

To check whether there are differences between sample input and output:

`diff <(pypy3 A/andxor.py <A/1.in) A/1.out`
